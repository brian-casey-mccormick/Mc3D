This Eclipse based Java project sets up a basic globe and renders various shapes on it.  To run it, you will need to obtain Java3D.  Obviously it was developed quite a long time ago and isn't really worth the effort to compile and run.  See the file Screenshot.png to get an idea of what it looks like when running.  I wrote this code to learn more about how to better use Java and to learn Java3D and to practice my up-and-coming 3D and algorithm skills.

The most interesting part of this work was the creation of a threat tube.  This is a tube representing the convex hall around a collection of 3D points.  The 3D points themselves are points along a collection of trajectories from a launch region to an impact region.  Also, there is an interesting function that rotates a viewer around a user clicked point on the map.  See ThreatTube.java, ConvexHull.java, and RotateAboutCenter.java for more information.
